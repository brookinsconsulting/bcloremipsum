2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using BC Lorem Ipsum extension:

   o  eZ publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ publish version 4.x or higher.

      eZ Publish 2011.10 (4.6+) is recommended.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 5.x or higher.


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from share.ez.no,
you will find the various versions at:

http://share.ez.no/download

NOTE: You will only require eZ Publish 4.x or higher (if you have a more recent version)

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.6/Installation
and
http://doc.ez.no
http://share.ez.no


Installing BC Lorem Ipsum extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcloremipsum-0_0_1.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcloremipsum-0_0_1.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcloremipsum

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcloremipsum

4. Use eZ Publish module view or command line script as needed.


Usage
==============================

Module view (This works for any siteaccess when accessed directly and with the required role permissions)

Command line create node script (and example usage with arguments)

The create node command line script: ./extension/bcbcloremipsum/bin/php/bcbcloremipsumcreatenode.php
